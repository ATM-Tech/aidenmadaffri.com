About 2 months ago, I made one of the most difficult yet rewarding technology switches of my life. All my life, I have considered myself a decent typist, not the fastest but I can hold a solid 70-90 WPM (words per minute). And until a few weeks before my switch, I never would have considered using anything other than QWERTY, until I started to feel something worrying&#x2026;

## What is Colemak?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak), &ldquo;Colemak is a keyboard layout for Latin-script alphabets, created by and named after Shai Coleman in 2006. The layout is designed to make typing more efficient and comfortable by placing the most frequent letters on the home row.&rdquo;

Essentially it is an alternative to other keyboard layouts like QWERTY and Dvorak made for the 21st century.
To truly understand the faults of QWERTY, you must first understand its history.

## The History of QWERTY

![QWERTY Layout](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/KB_United_States.svg)

QWERTY was developed in the 1870s by Christopher Latham Sholes and E. Remington and Sons (Company) for typewriters. The layout would become popular after the popularity of the Remington No. 2 of 1878 and remains almost universal today. QWERTY went through several iterations before landing on the layout we know today but several problems guided the creation.

Initially, the alphabet was essentially laid out alphabetically on the typewriter, but this caused an issue. Due to the nature of a typewriter, the machine would often jam due to the arms next to each other clashing against each other when pressed in succession. This was fixed by analyzing the frequency of bigrams (letter-pairs) and placing each letter as far away as possible from ones likely to be pressed next.

The order of the letters in the top row is also completely arbitrary, and its only guiding principle was the ability to spell &ldquo;TYPEWRITER&rdquo; in one row. This would allow salesmen to better show off the new device.

## Advantages of Colemak

[colemak.com](https://colemak.com/) states 3 major advantages to other keyboard layouts.

1.  Ergonomics
2.  Ease of Learning
3.  Speed

I will briefly go over each one


<a id="org550b2bd"></a>

#### Ergonomics

1.  The 10 most common letters are the letters on the home row, reducing finger movement.
2.  Optimized for less same finger typing, with QWERTY requiring 340% more (e.x. &rsquo;ceded&rsquo;).
3.  The pinky is given the weakest letters to prevent from stretching the weakest finger.
4.  Tries to reduce long sequences of same-hand typing by grouping most of the vowels on the right side.


<a id="orgf17de95"></a>

#### Ease of Learning

1.  Common keyboard shortcuts stay in the same location (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V)
2.  Keys remain close to their positions in QWERTY, making it easier to look for the keys if you need to. This also applies the other way around after you learn Colemak.
3.  Punctuation keys all stay in the same positions.
4.  Only two keys move between hands.


<a id="orgc96379f"></a>

#### Speed

1.  Backspace on the home row (optional) reduces the amount of time it takes to correct errors.
2.  Ergonomic advantages improve comfort allowing you to maintain the same typing speed for longer.

## Flaws of Colemak

Alternatives to Colemak have been developed due to some flaws in its placement of certain bigrams. One such is the [Workman layout](https://workmanlayout.org/) which claims to improve on Colemak by making the &rsquo;HE&rsquo; bigram (the second most common in the English language) less straining on your hands. However, Workman is very different from Colemak, changing 21 keys instead of 17 and changing the location of common shortcuts. This &rsquo;HE&rsquo; bigram was quite annoying to me on default Colemak though and I wanted to find a solution. I switched to a minor variation of Colemak called [Mod-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) which seeks to solve this problem. I will not be going in-depth about the mod in this post as I feel like the thoughts below describe both layouts well.


<a id="orgdba622a"></a>

## Why I Switched

I am very interested in technology and thus spend a lot of time at my desk typing (especially during the COVID-19 quarantine). A couple of weeks before my switch, I began to notice symptoms of CTS (Carpal tunnel syndrome) and RSI (Repetitive strain injury). I knew that I still had many years of sitting at a desk and knew I needed to make a drastic change to save my hands from irreversible damage.


<a id="org7e662bf"></a>

## My Journey

I chose a rather hard path to relearn typing. Instead of just practicing Colemak a few times a day and using QWERTY when I needed to, I switched completely cold turkey. This ended up being a long struggle but I think it was worth it in the end. If I had to work or study at all during this time, switching cold turkey would have been out of the question, but my abundance of time during the quarantine made this option viable.


<a id="org57cfd03"></a>

#### Week 1

Having used computers all my life, I can&rsquo;t even began to describe how hard using one was at the time. Even basic things like searching for a program on your computer became a 15-second task. Every single keypress was conscious. Instead of thinking of each word I was typing, I had to think about each individual letter and where it was located on the keyboard. By the end of the week, I was able to get up to 25 WPM, but my muscle memory had not yet set in. At the same time, my QWERTY speed had crashed as my memory readjusted.


<a id="orgf08c76c"></a>

#### Week 2-3

Fortunately, the helpless stage did not last very long. By this time, I was making steady increases in my typing speeds every day as my muscle memory began to form. While using a computer was slow, they were perfectly usable as I became more familiar with the layout.


<a id="org41fdf6a"></a>

#### Week 4-5

After about a month, I would say my transition was almost over. I was up to a very comfortable typing speed (70 WPM) on Colemak and was able to reclaim my QWERTY speed as well. My speed does still increase slowly, so I&rsquo;m excited to see if I soon pass my previous top speed.


<a id="org6d13822"></a>

## Resources I Used to Learn

During my journey, I used two main websites to learn the layout. First, I used [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) which attempts to teach each letter individually and slowly adds new letters as you become more familiar with others. After I became familiar with every key on the keyboard I began to use [monkey-type.com](https://monkey-type.com/) to practice my general speed.


<a id="org9dd25c0"></a>

## Should I Use Colemak?

This is a question only you can answer. However, I think there are some criteria. If you plan to be typing regularly per day, you are at higher risk for RSI and CTS and might be thankful you switched before these conditions had time to take effect. And while I can&rsquo;t conclude yet, I believe that in the long run, Colemak allows for a faster overall typing speed, which might be very useful to certain professions and tasks.


<a id="org5a02ba1"></a>

## Questions I Asked


<a id="orgb4c4fb5"></a>

#### How long will it take me to learn?

Unfortunately, this question has no real answer as it will be different for everyone. There are many factors such as the amount of practicing, current typing technique, and how fast you generally learn (age could be a cause of this). In my example, I switched completely cold turkey, with bad typing habits, while practicing 3-4 hours a day, and it took me about a month to reach 75% of my previous top speed.


<a id="orgf9a2caa"></a>

#### What about gaming?

Gaming with Colemak is definitely no problem for me. However, while some might rebind all their keys in games, this is completely unnecessary. Instead, you can continue to game with WASD and QWERTY by simply changing to QWERTY for games. Windows and other operating systems make it easy to switch keyboard layouts on the fly, and technologies like [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm) embedded in keyboards allow setting up dedicated layers for your old layout.


<a id="org9c59a15"></a>

#### Will I still be able to type QWERTY?

This also relies on several factors. In my mind, QWERTY is a completely different set of muscle memory due to my bad typing habits with it. I can switch to thinking in terms of QWERTY with my old habits (although my speed has fallen to about the same as my Colemak speed). Now, switching is just like a bike, it takes a few minutes to get in the hang of it, but then you are as good as ever with it. And as with anything, as long as you keep practicing/using both layouts, you should have no struggle keeping up on both.


<a id="orgc7f014f"></a>

#### Should I use it on my phone?

No.

According to [colemak.com](https://colemak.com/), &ldquo;Colemak isn&rsquo;t recommended for smartphones as it increases finger travel and error rate compared to QWERTY.&rdquo;


<a id="org81c535f"></a>

#### Should I change my keycaps or print out labels?

While you can, this might impede your progress instead of aid it. This may allow you to rely on looking down at the keyboard instead of purely memorizing the positions of the keys.


<a id="orgf0d4d5a"></a>

#### What about keyboard-driven editors like Vi(m)?

Take my answer with a grain of salt as I have only used Vim for about a year now, but I found that my memorization of editor commands was based on their mnemonic rather than their position (e.x. &rsquo;w&rsquo; for next word), so changing to Colemak did not impact most editor commands for me.

#####  But what about HJKL?

This could have a slightly bigger impact on your transition. Some Colemak users report that you get used to it over time however it was a rather jarring change to me. What I ended up doing instead, was placing the arrow keys on the home row in a new layer (using [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm)). This allowed me access to easy access to movement keys at any time in any application.


<a id="org622ed3a"></a>

## Conclusion

Was switching to Colemak worth it for me? I think it was. Switching allowed me to get a head start on the possible conditions I might&rsquo;ve faced in the future and gave me a much more comfortable typing experience every day. As compared to QWERTY, typing in my new layout has much more rhythm and is overall a much more enjoyable task. I would highly encourage anyone with the time to at least give it a chance, and you may end up wondering how you ever used QWERTY in the first place.

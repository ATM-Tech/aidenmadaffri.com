Hello everyone, today I am introducing my blog to you.
Here I intend to post about technology's applications and effects to our daily lives.
I've already got several ideas and posts lined up to write and I'm hoping to post at least once a month.
Unfortunately I haven't got email notifications set up quite yet, but for now if you want to stay up to date you can subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://aidenmadaffri.com/posts/index.xml) with your favorite RSS reader.
Anyway, I will see y'all in the next post.

The internet is often something we take for granted in our lives. It is such a huge boiling pot of so many different influences that we never take a step back from to evaluate their effects. Realizing this, I decided to take one week off from the internet to see what influences were positive and which were not.

## My Constraints

It should be noted that I didn&rsquo;t completely abstain from all technology. I still had access to my computer and phone. Many of my hobbies and passions take place on technology and I wouldn&rsquo;t be very productive without it. I downloaded only 3 resources from the internet to use while I was offline: my choir tracks to practice, a book to study for an IT certification that I am preparing for, and some resources to refer to in writing some of the upcoming blog posts. And obviously I kept my phone (with mobile data turned off) so I could still be contacted in the case of an emergency.

## Key Takeaways

I think my biggest takeaway from the whole experience was that I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was missing anything. This huge resource and time sink was taken out of my life and I barely even noticed, but I felt the effects from its absence in a couple huge ways.

#### Productivity

This week was possibly one of the most productive weeks of my life. During this time I: completed 3 blog posts, read 3 books, took notes on 4 books (I usually take notes after I have completed a book), learned 5 new difficult songs, and studied roughly 25% of the material for my upcoming IT certification exam. When you have no distractions to turn to, it is very easy to turn to another difficult gratifying task to complete, and during this task, there were no notifications or apps on my phone to check. The urge to check Social Media or other apps was still present but felt less and less important as the week went on.

#### Infinity Pools (Social Media)

Infinity Pools (a term from the book [Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Time-Focus-Matters-Every/dp/0525572422)) are sources of endlessly replenishing content like YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, etc. that you can theoretically put an infinite amount of time into. Once removed from your life, you realize exactly how much time they are sucking up and what little value they give in return. Sure, you can justify to yourself that &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m only using [insert service] for like 5-10 minutes at a time,&rdquo; but at the end of the day that may add up to an hour you could have been used to further your studies or career. Using this justification over a whole year costs you about 9 full work weeks of time. If that time was spent doing something productive and enriching to your life each day, you might be much further in your life than you currently are.

#### Access to Information

Now one thing I want to get straight, is that the internet is definitely not a bad thing. Without it, you lose access to much of the information you might need in a minutes notice. Certain simple things became hard. There&rsquo;s two examples I experienced that clearly highlight this point. Firstly, I need to adjust a refrigerator&rsquo;s temperature, I knew the optimal temperatures for both the fridge and freezer in Fahrenheit, but the temperature gauge was in Celsius. Having not have memorized the conversion, I was completely out of luck of setting the temperature. Luckily, someone else in the house knew the correct setting but I would have been largely unable to fix it (besides trial and error). The second instance happened at a restaurant. As this was during the COVID-19 pandemic, many restaurants decided to forego paper menus for online menus accessed by QR codes. I began to scan the code like normal and was greeted with a no connection page.

## My Next Steps

Instead of simply making the observations like many would do, I decided I needed to act on them, and try to resolve them.

#### Productivity

As I noted above, my main disruptions to productivity were task switching and notifications. My issues with task switching were mainly caused by infinity pools so my solutions to those can be found below. My solution to notifications was to take a whole new perspective to them. The ability for a non-essential email to attract my attention from a notification is completely unnecessary. Upon this realization, I disabled nearly every notification on both my phone and computer, leaving only text messages, phone calls, and emails from an account that I know only time sensitive emails go to. Already I have experienced a huge boost in productivity from this simple change.

#### Infinity Pools (Social Media)

I think an important thing to note about Social Media is that they have their place in our lives. I believe that no platform was ever created as a worthless time sucking creation, and at one point or another had some specific targeted use. Therefore, Social Media is only bad if we use them in lousy ways without regard to why we are using them. Realizing this, I sought to attach a specific use to each platform I used --- to think of them like a tool. In addition, you need to break the habit of constantly checking these platforms and instead only check them as it fits the description of your tool. The main platforms I will touch on here (and my biggest time sinks) are Reddit and YouTube.

##### Reddit

Firstly while most use Reddit for entertainment, I always found a lot of valuable information on the platform as well. Entertaining content is dangerous as it likely never ends (infinity pool), so I now use Reddit purely for information. I have blocked /r/all, unsubscribed from all subreddits, and now do all my reading (because it is mostly text posts) in two multireddits, one centered around Linux related subreddits, and the other centered around homelabbing and IT related subreddits. This cuts down my amount of &ldquo;addicting&rdquo; content 1000% and allows me to check Reddit only once or twice a day.

##### YouTube

Though, I do know that entertainment does have its place, so I deemed YouTube my platform for entertainment. Like Reddit, I have blocked the Homepage, suggestions, and other infinitely populating fields (through browser extension [DF YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/df-youtube/)) and stuck purely to subscribed channels. I also considerably lowered my subscriptions being careful that I only left content I truly found entertaining and wasn&rsquo;t just watching because it was in my feed. One of the categories I thoroughly removed were &ldquo;Edutainment&rdquo; channels like Wendover Productions and CGP Grey, while these channels have very interesting and educational content, I found I never retained this information (though some people may) so I deemed them unnecessary. These changes, like the rest, also gave me a lot more time.

#### Replacements

With a huge increase in time, you need something to replace the old habits and fill this newly acquired time. With nothing to fill the time, your old habits will return as quick as they left. The replacement will be different for everyone, maybe you decide to read instead, maybe to work on a blog (as I am right now), or maybe to learn a new skill you&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn. I can&rsquo;t know what the right replacement is for you. As a student, I found a new application called Anki which fills the old reflex of pulling out my phone and checking Reddit. For lack of better words, Anki essentially provide an interface and algorithm for glorified flash cards, but I will touch on it more in my upcoming post about the software.

## Conclusion

Is the Internet a valuable resource? Certainly. Is it without its traps and downsides like any other tool? Certainly not. My one week without the Internet was a huge, eye opening experience that has changed how I think of the World Wide Web completely. Never again will I look at a new upcoming platform or website and not think about the implications it might have on my productivity, time, and life overall. I encourage everyone to try a similar experiment and see what they discover. Sometimes, its not until we distance ourselves from something that we can truly have perspective.

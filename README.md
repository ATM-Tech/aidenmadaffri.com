[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4fca5edc-077f-44d5-95f3-6bf04e7382d8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/aidenmadaffri/deploys)

The source files for https://aidenmadaffri.com made with Hugo and the [Toha theme](https://github.com/hossainemruz/toha), hosted on Netlify.

The main development for this website happens on my [personal GitLab instance](https://dev.madaffri.com/ATMTech/aidenmadaffri.com/), the GitHub mirror is simply to interface with Netlify.
